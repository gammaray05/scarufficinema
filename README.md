# Scaruffi Formatted Cinema Ratings

A time-to-time updated data collectors-friendly list of movie ratings by piero scaruffi (scaruffi.com), from 1998 to present.
Parsed by copy and paste and then formatted into tables using Excel.


If someone can help me parsing metadata (movies' years above all, but also Metascore, Rotten and IMDB's ratings would be fun), that would be great.
